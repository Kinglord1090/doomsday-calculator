# Doomsday Calculator üóìÔ∏è

This project is a date calculator that determines the day of the week for any given date using an algorithmic approach. It prompts the user to enter a date in the `dd-mm-yyyy` format and calculates the corresponding day of the week efficiently. The tool is useful for quickly finding historical or future weekdays.

## Features

- **Efficient Day Calculation**: Utilizes a mathematical algorithm to determine the day of the week accurately for any date input by the user.
- **User-Friendly Input**: Accepts dates in `dd-mm-yyyy` format and provides a clear output indicating the day of the week.
- **Comprehensive Support for All Dates**: Handles both historical and future dates without any limitations.
- **Error Handling**: Basic input validation ensures that the date is entered correctly to prevent runtime errors.
- **Extensibility**: The code is structured for easy modification, allowing enhancements like date range support or additional date-related functionalities.
